# README

We've all been there, you sign a yearly lease for a rental property only to discover issues (some of which arise with time) that lower your quality of life. From absent landlords to noisy neighbors, you name it. Now with Rentscape you can write and look up reviews of any potential rental property and see what you're getting yourself into before making any commitments.

## USAGE

# Sorting Properties

On the main page, on the top right corner you'll find the search menu, where you'll access filtering options to search for properties.

# Adding a property review

When you click on Add Property you'll be taken to the form where you can add a new property review, please note that a photo/image is not necessary but if you decide to upload one make sure it's in the JPG or PNG format. Save the delete keyword somewhere safe, you'll need it if you ever plan on deleting your review.

# Deleting a property review

At the bottom of the review page, you'll find a field to submit the delete keyword, by pressing 'delete' you're review will be permanently deleted from Rentscape.

## ROADMAP

Eventually I'd like to add a bit more depth to the reviews: A discussion board on each property, allow multi image upload, and comments attached to each image.
